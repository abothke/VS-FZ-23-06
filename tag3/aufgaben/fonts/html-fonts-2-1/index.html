    <p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it,
        making people wait behind me while I complain. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidatesâ€¦ PUNY HUMAN NUMBER
        ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.</p>
    <p>Oh Leela! <strong> You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me. </strong>

    <p>Humans dating robots is sick. You people wonder why I'm still single? It's 'cause all the fine robot sisters are
        dating humans! Large bet on myself in round one. Yep, I remember.</p>
